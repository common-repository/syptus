Automatically integrate with wordpress platform to import content into Syptus app for deeper content analytics

== Description ==

Note: You must be an existing customer of Syptus to be able to use this plugin. 

Syptus CMP is a powerful content analytics platform that allows customers to build powerful content inventory, audit and planning solutions by pulling in data from wordpress. To know more about Syptus CMP, please visit https://www.syptus.com or contact info@syptus.com.

== Plugin usage ==
The plugin uses a custom authentication scheme that does not require users to share their Wordpress login details. From your Syptus account login(Wordpress configuration area), grab your Client Secret and Client Id and enter them into the
plugin settings. That is it! You can now import your Wordpress content assets into Syptus and run automated audit to get insights into multiple content metrics. 

== Installation ==
Installation is similar to any other WordPress plugin installation. You can either upload the plugin to your plugin directory (generally wp-content/plugins) or install through WordPress\'s built-in web based installer.
To set up the plugin, go to Settings-->Syptus CMP from within your Wordpress Dashboard and add the required credentials. Only users with Administrator privileges will see the plugin settings menu.
